## November 2014

Projects listing page design at Greenpoint's Budin, a nordic coffee bar. Each project got a circular logo that lifted up on hover, allowing the title to fade in. The simplistic homepage read 'Peter Szerzo, interactive developer and designer'.

## December 2014

I did first experiments to create front page animation, not intended for a front page animation yet.

## March 2015

Front page animation is abstracted to involve triangles instead of country shapes. In a highly sub-optimal fashion, it makes the homepage.

## July 2015

Move to React.js, keeping the Backbone models used previously.

## November 2015

Redux is hooked into the site and the content moves to a Postgres database. Backbone is out.
