We often look back at things we wrote in the past with a slight uneasy feeling. It could be an opinion we don't agree with anymore, a paragraph exposing stronger versions of the shortcomings we're still working on, thoughts we would rather hide from others or at least rewrite/explain before sharing. It could also be something we just never really meant.

My Facebook post that rolled out in the sunny Sunday afternoon of February 23rd, 2014 could be one of these today:

> Dear Friends,
>
> I am deactivating my Facebook account in the coming days. It is finally time to break free of all the clutter it comes with. Also time to keep communication genuine and meaningful.
>
> My Gmail, Skype, Etsy store and website (etsy.com/shop/dchisel and dchisel.com) will obviously remain live. Stay in touch there!
>
> Cheers,
>
> Peter

For the most part, though, it isn't. True, it is only a stretch of 18 months that stand between the fellow who wrote the Facebook post and the voice you are reading now, but that gap happened to include a quarter crisis, a bald, successful and liberating career change and a thorough introduction into mindfulness and meditation practices. With a risk of making a claim that I myself will disagree with in the future, I have learned many of the most important lessons of my life.

Yet the comments I have on my last Facebook post would only point to the need for a tad bit more stylistic polish and a tad fewer strong words (also, dchisel.com isn't live anymore, though it was a cute site in its days). Other than that, the content is still very much agreeable to me. That said, it is best understood with some context and reflection. It is time to do some of that now.

Right after I made the post live from the 24th floor of a Manhattan high-rise I used to work in during the week and tutor in on the weekends, I hopped on the subway to ride home to Bushwick, Brooklyn. I didn't expect to get much of a reaction (I have never been very active on Facebook), and sure enough, after an hour underground without cellular data, all I got was a handful of messages from people jokingly disappointed that they won't have a way to stay in touch with me anymore ('Good job, 21st century', I said to myself). Two days later, I deactivated, and didn't log back in again until I decided to fully delete my account earlier this year.

A close friend deactivated a couple of months after I did, and the fact that my act served as encouragement for hers was just about the most positive reaction I got. Among the rest was some whispered praise, a lot of lifted eyebrows, and some outloud ridicule. The only rational response came from my mother as I insisted on waiting to somehow get the e-mail address of my brother's former high school classmate who could advise me on foreign tax matters: "I know it's against your principles, but..". What followed was that I should get on Facebook, because that is the only way to reach him. I later found out that he in fact does not check his Facebook, and happily replied to the e-mail after two hours.

But then came something interesting: the ridicule I got was followed up with apologies, corrections and expressions of respect, a generic example of which I attempted to reproduce here:

> Actually, I only meant to rip on people who deactivate their accounts with an oh-so-wise farewell message and silently slip back after three weeks. What you did was legit. 

On the other hand, the approval I got tended to come with doubts on how I am a real earthly being whom they can even poke in the shoulder (unclear intentions with regards to the pun). Time and time again I found myself thinking:

> Wow, we have some seriously mixed feelings about Facebook.

Mixed feelings extend to among journalists who write on the 'Facebook, good or bad?' topic (though I didn't find anything good other than Facebook's own evaluation). Several, such as this [Huffington Post Article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/facebook-study_n_5595890.html), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy), [Huffington again](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html) or [Facebook's own study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/29/facebook-experiment-psychological_n_5540018.html) voiced adverse mental health effects that stem from lack of purpose, envy triggered by other people's flawlessly pictured lives, comparing, out- and overdoing and then comparing again. Myself, many of my close friends (I mean, friends), and surely many many others were aware of these adverse effects of the Facebook experience. What I also knew was that such arguments tend to not stand a chance against our fundamental desire to fit in go with the crowd, explaining why people will keep posting, liking and poking whether it is good or bad for their emotional well-being. Going against this is a rare game to be played.

[One Atlantic article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/ways-to-use-facebook-without-feeling-depressed/389916/) finally offered a more positive voice on Facebook, focusing on its healthy use instead of lamenting on the apparently inevitable unhealthy one. If we use Facebook healthily, we may break free from adverse effects, even if the interviewer and interviewee of the article spoke hesitantly about the extent to which this is possible. Supposing that it is, then mustering the willpower to not compare ourselves to others would, as the article suggests, free us from negative emotions. Sure, we'd still have to deal with other bad addictions such as the ones to like maximization or stalking, but it's a start. If I let my optimistic nature be in charge for a bit, I may even feel that deleting the account is an overkill.

Luckily for me, I am also a realist, and I also do not forget. I vividly remember the restless, achy, sometimes nauseous feeling in my head and stomach after browsing too much, believing overly positive representations or misrepresentations of people's lives, or getting dozens of birthday wishes from people who only occasionally say hi to me on the streets. Forcing an optimistic thinking onto myself in this case would be nothing but an utterly pointless act of hipocrisy. The line of thought ultimately let me to the following conslusion: whoever deletes their account should really just admit to weak willpower. Sigh. Well, here we go:

> My name is Peter, I am 25 years old, and I have weak willpower.

I have to say, this confession was way easier than I had thought. In fact, if you give me a crowd, a pedestal and a flashy bow tie, I will happily repeat it in public. It gets even easier as I look at all the psychological research and [self-improvement websites](http://fiercegentleman.com/science-of-behavior-change/) backing me up. All of a sudden, I feel more companionship and validation than what I got from hundreds of Facebook friends back in the day.

About a year ago, I decided to quit alcohol and processed sugar (which, along with quitting Facebook, seems like the recipe for immortality), and I stuck to it with occasional exceptions while traveling. However, according to my stance on Facebook, I possess just about as much willpower than my roommate's pitbull (you should see her trying to abstain from peanut butter). It took me time and intense bursts of frustration, but I am finally ok with it. In fact, I believe that embracing it will do me a lot of good.

I certinly agree with all the voices out there saying that Facebook isn't bad, and if I use it right, I should be fine. However, using it right includes not doing a whole lot of things the platform encourages us to do by its design. The lack of focus when it comes to content and the encouragement to make as many friends as possible (more is better, right?) are two aspects that I believe create the Facebook experience that I walked away from, while staying on all other online platforms that had profiles and friend relationships. Maybe I have weaker willpower than others, and maybe browsing Facebook impacts my possibly rare personality type more negatively. Or perhaps it is the case that many others would also walk away from Facebook (don't we hear that yearning a lot?) if not for a couple of seriously compelling reasons:

* if they could only make the confession I made above (which is really easy and liberating).
* if they were not concerned about losing touch with other people (especially since the only alternative to Facebook is the rather sassy and unreliable messenger pigeon).
* if their group, school, club etc. didn't use it as sole means of communication (which is such a good choice of platform that I am sending out honorary medals for it as we speak).
* if they were willing to give up the convenience of its messaging system (certainly more important than mental health).

Given this amazing web and mobile technology on our hands today - with many of the coolest innovations being developed among Facebook's own developer teams - such reasons still have the power to keep us pursuing recreational experiences that don't make us feel good. Sad and depressing as this sounds, there is also something really great about it. What mixed, conflicting feelings around Facebook use indicate to me is that we are mere social media adolescents. The voices out there saying:

> Oh my god, Facebook is so bad, but look at that adorable cat on my best friend's selfie. 

shows that it is taking us some time to become the social media adults whose experience engaging in digital connection make them feel somewhat similar to the way face-to-face human connection should make them feel: amazing. It can only propel us towards a better social media experience, one whose sprouts may already be out there. I happen to have non-addictive, meaningful and all-in-all a good time discovering music on Soundcloud, looking for a place to crash on and new friends on Couchsurfing.com, and find people with similar interests on Meetup. Maybe it is the focused nature of these sites that takes away Facebook's staleness and subtle mental taxation. Maybe we'll shift more in this focused direction, maybe in a different one, maybe we'll shift trends on what to post, who we friend and what we like on Facebook. Regardless of what the road is, I know that we will be moving for the better. It is not in our nature to stand still when we feel about something the way we do about Facebook.

And so, all I want to leave you with is to share with you how stoked I am for the future. Oh, and also a request: be so kind to e-mail me the details of that board game night this coming Saturday. Somehow I missed the last four.
