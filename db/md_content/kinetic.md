The Deployable Smart Mast was my first really serious and really fun college research project on the intersection of code, mechanics and geometry.

The mast was built as proof of concept for a structure that adapts its shape based on outside weather conditions, an idea explored under Prof. Sigrid Adriaenssens and Prof. Branko Glisic at Princeton. The acrylic prototype was equipped with a number of heat sensors along its height, and if any of them was triggered, a linear actuator changed the mast's height to stay clear of danger.

I was responsible for the conceptual design of the 3d geometry, as well as programming the motion control of the structure based on the sensors' input. A couple of late nights later, we had something to show, after which came the fun part:

The prototype was demoed to middle school students in New Jersey in the fall of 2010. The students interacted with the prototype, making it lower to a certain height by applying hot air using a blowdrier. At the same time, the a computer screen displayed the current and target geometries of the tower. Humans, computer and prototype all interacted by responding to and validating each othersâ€™ actions.

The project got published in [Engineering Structures](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.12013/abstract).

Inspired by this project, I conducted a parametric exploration of pantograph shapes, from wireframe design to physical prototypes and fabrication methods.
