On a cloudy afternoon during our freshman year of high school, I and two good friends, Tamás Plugor and Tamás Gajdó, sat down to blend together our love for basketball with our love for code and graphics. In a couple of hours, we wrote the bulk of our first presentable game: PBA, or Pascal Basketball Association.

There is a big piece of history in this project. [Borland Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) - hence the name of the game - was the programming language in which I wrote my first sorting algorithm (the first double for loop was in C++ a couple of years before), first linked lists, graphs, trees and backtracking algorithms. The most memorable ones, though, were the graphics experiments: particle-springs animations, light rays bouncing around a random arrangement of mirrors, a kaleidoscope and many many fractals. Still, even out of these, dearest to my heart is PBA. There was something coding it in a small team and sharing it with the entire class that made it special.

And so, to satisfy my nostalgic nature, I reconstructed the game in Processing, true to its original looks (though without a menu, name prompt and the high score registry). Through Processing.js, it is now available in the browser. [Ready for that unforgiving hoop](http://pickled-plugins.github.io/pba/)?
