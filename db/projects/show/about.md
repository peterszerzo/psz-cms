This is Peter, web developer, designer, (natural) language enthusiast, yogi, cook. An all-in-all friendly, enthusiastic fellow with a green thumb and an open mind.

I develop sites and apps - the full-stack thereof - though with my strength and heart at user interfaces and graphics. I work with and get inspiration from the following technologies: React.js, Backbone.js, Marionette.js, d3.js, three.js, leaflet.js and elegant SASS-sheets at my site users' fingertips, and Node.js, Express.js as well as Ruby on Rails behind the scenes.

But enough about the web! I am interested in using code outside of the browser, from architectural and jewelry design to natural language processing, animation and computational art. A fresh idea on how to extend, refactor, decouple and semanticize often comes from the outside.

Also, I teach! From helping a friend through the (insanely hard) Romanian mathematics baccalaureat through high-school English, pre-med Physics, digital fabrication and finally mentoring a web developer intern, I take enjoyment in communicating, explaining and listening, and most importantly, igniting excitement both around and within me.

Here's how you find me on the web (coming soon). Let's talk!
