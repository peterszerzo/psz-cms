This is Peter, web developer, designer, (natural) language enthusiast, yogi, cook. An all-in-all friendly, enthusiastic fellow with eager-to-pedal feet, a green thumb and a curious mind.

I develop sites and apps - the full-stack thereof - though my strengths and heart lie in clean, well-factored user interfaces and beautiful, elaborate graphics. I work with and get inspiration from the following technologies: React.js, Backbone.js, Marionette.js, d3.js, three.js, leaflet.js and elegant SASS-sheets at my site users' fingertips, and Node.js, Express.js as well as Ruby on Rails behind the scenes.

But enough about the web! I am interested in using code outside of the browser, from architectural and jewelry design to natural language processing, animation and computational art. A fresh idea on how to extend, refactor, decouple and semanticize often comes from the outside.

Also, I teach! From helping a friend through the (insanely hard) Romanian mathematics baccalaureat through high-school English, pre-med Physics, digital fabrication and finally mentoring a web developer intern, I take enjoyment in communicating, explaining and listening, and most importantly, igniting excitement both around and within me.

You can find me on my bike on the streets of DC, its hip spots such as Compass Coffee or Slipstream, as well as on [GitHub](https://github.com/pickled-plugins), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterszerzo), [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/szerzo1), [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/mighty-comfortable) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/bbo-listen). Let's talk!
