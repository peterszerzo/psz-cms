Giraffe became the most rounded of my software efforts that aimed to streamline architectural and structural design processes in the majorly hectic world of large-scale constructions. It is a plug-in that organizes and stores complex design geometries in a master-model inside Rhinoceros 3d (one of the best 3d modelers in wide use by architects today) and exports seamlessly to the somewhat sad world of structural engineering software stuck in the 70's. To illustrate the sadness, it will suffice to say that one of the world-leading such software packages, SOFiSTiK, builds up its models in Fortran, which I used extensively in the year 2014. 

Luckily, Giraffe did much of the heavy lifting once it was created. It served bravely during the preliminary design of the [Hudson Yards skyscrapers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Yards_Redevelopment_Project) specialty facades at Schlaich Bergermann and Partner LP, allowing for design modeling up to three times faster. Also less error-prone. And happier.
