Aimed to streamline architectural and structural design processes to the majorly hectic world of large-scale constructions, Giraffe for Rhino is a plug-in that stores and serves design geometries in a master-model inside Rhinoceros 3d and exports to the somewhat sad world of engineering software stuck in the 70's. To illustrate my point: yes, I coded in Fortran in the year 2014 (and was getting pretty good at it, too). Luckily, Giraffe became the go-to way to restrict this activity to the minimum.

Giraffe served during the design process of the [Hudson Yards skyscrapers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Yards_Redevelopment_Project) specialty facades at Schlaich Bergermann and Partner LP, allowing for design modeling up to three times faster. Also less error-prone. And happier.
