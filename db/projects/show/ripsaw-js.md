Walking around in Fishs Eddy - a kitchenware store in Manhattan - on a November evening in
2013, I was struck by a thought: what if I tried to create an app that allows everybody, regardless
of their background, to interactively manipulate and customize their own utensils, shelves,
jewelry, and receive them 3d printed in the mail?

ripsaw.js was born as a result of this effort.
