This animated arrangement of abstract triangular map regions called GeoSociety currently occupies the home page of my website.

By recreating an abstract map made up of simplified units that could be thought of as cities, states, countries, neighborhoods, I am looking to expose 'cross-border' interactions that do not read well off of actual maps. The triangles may have sentiments of unity, isolation, transition, journey, stagnation or claustrophobia depending on their identity as well as their neighbors'.

Yet our own image of these identities can be hardly biased, even without our awareness. An encounter with a single person may shape our image of a country (for me at least), and so do articles or documentaries with an overly particular focus.

I would like to invite you to focus on similarities rather than the cultural differences that sometimes seem so vast, and enjoy a moment of expression and empathy.
