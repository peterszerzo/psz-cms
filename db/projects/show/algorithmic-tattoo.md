This simple yet mysterious, highly mathematical shape took a curious journey starting at a geometry problem, through the drawings of a shelf design, all the way to becoming first a logo, then an ink drawing on my upper back. Here is its story.

The city voronoi algorithm stands as basis of this tattoo design was the second [ripsaw.js](pickled-plugins.github.io/ripsaw-demo) design experiment I dabbled with to create intricate ways of dividing up wallspace and creating shelves. If we look at a map of a city with post offices, this method splits up the city into regions defined by a single post office each. Anywhere you may find yourself in the city, the region you are in will tell you which post office is the closest. A simple Voronoi diagram does this by linear distance and yields a dragonflywing-like mesh that I never found particularly appealing. However, if one is only allowed to move in north-south and east-west directions such as in Manhattan, the subdivisions take a much more interesting shape.

Nonetheless, these diagrams have always made me feel a hint of anxiety, as symbols of highly optimized and efficient existence where everything circulates around linear efficiency in time and money. Paths are not chosen by intuition or emotions, but by algorithms solving highly rational problems. The former are therefore suppressed.

This closed shape and mindset set the starting point of the design process. Once I arrived at a particular shape I like, I start removing links from it. It is a very liberating process to break the system and allow for what I perceive as passageways, spontaneity, travel and freedom of thought. It came together by accident, but there is a shape in the image that kind of resembles a person in fetal position, hinting at rebirth.

The tattoo was completed in November 2015 in Brooklyn, New York, after I have personally experienced a kind of liberation resembling the story of the design itself.
