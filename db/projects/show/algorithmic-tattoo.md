This simple, mysterious, highly mathematical shape took a curious journey from math textbooks through the drawings of a shelf design, all the way to becoming first a logo, then an ink drawing on my upper back. Here is its story.

I started writing [ripsaw.js](pickled-plugins.github.io/ripsaw-demo) to experiment with geometric shapes that are highly customizable by the layman, yet intricate enough to be satisfying and a potential form of self-expression. The city voronoi algorithm that stands as basis of this tattoo design was the second design experiment I dabbled with to create intricate ways to divide up wallspace and create shelves.

This diagram is a way to split up parts of a city into regions around post offices. Anywhere you may find yourself in the city, the region you are in will tell you which post office is the closest. A simple Voronoi diagram does it by linear distance and yields a dragonflywing-like mesh that I never found particularly appealing. 

To me, this diagram screams of anxiety. It came off as the symbol of highly optimized and efficient existence where everything circulates around linear time and money. Paths are not chosen by intuition or emotions, but by algorithms. The former are therefore suppressed.

This closed shape and mindset set the starting point of my design process. Once I arrive at a particular shape I like, I start removing links from it. It is a very liberating process to break the system and allow for what I perceive as passageways, spontaneity, travel and freedom of thought. It came together by accident, but there is a shape in the image that kind of resembles a person in fetal position, hinting at rebirth.

This was exactly the transformation that New York has brought about in me. I was so caught up in the closed grid that liberation became the only way out, a necessity to not go crazy.
