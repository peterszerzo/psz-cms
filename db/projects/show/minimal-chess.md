A highly minimalistic look at the chess set.

Seeing the elaboration of chess set designs over centuries and cultures, I've decided to take a minimalistic look at it.

I knew I wanted to go 2d first, so that. 

I also got interested in redefining the roles of the figures by assigning them shoes. This highlighted different characteristics of the players: modern, formal elegance instead of royal might for the king, strength, status and feminine for the queen, a detachment of the knight's horse from its rider. The pawns 

Discrete hatches distinguish between the two sides.

The set was hand-drawn, digitally reworked, then lasercut. Playing with it can be confusing.
