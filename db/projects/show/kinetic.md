The mast was built as proof of concept for a structure that adapts its shape based on outside weather conditions.

The acrylic prototype was equipped with a number of heat sensors along its height. If any of them was triggered, a linear actuator lowered the tower to the height of the trigger.

I was responsible for detailed design of the 3d geometry, as well as programming the sensors and the linear actuator.

The prototype was demoed to middle school students in New Jersey in the fall of 2010. The students interacted with the prototype, making it lower to a certain height by applying hot air using a blowdrier.

At the same time, the a computer screen displayed the current and target geometries of the tower. Humans, computer and prototype all interacted by responding to and validating each othersâ€™ actions.

The design concept was published in Engineering Structures.

Inspired by this project, I conducted a parametric exploration of pantograph shapes, from wireframe design to physical prototypes and fabrication methods.
