We often look back at things we wrote in the past with a slight uneasy feeling. It could be an opinion we don't agree with anymore, a paragraph exposing stronger versions of the shortcomings we're still working on, thoughts we would rather hide from others or at least rewrite/explain before sharing. It could also be something we just never really meant.

My Facebook post that rolled out in the sunny Sunday afternoon of February 23rd, 2014 could be one of these today:

> Dear Friends,
>
> I am deactivating my Facebook account in the coming days. It is finally time to break free of all the clutter it comes with. Also time to keep communication genuine and meaningful.
>
> My Gmail, Skype, Etsy store and website (etsy.com/shop/dchisel and dchisel.com) will obviously remain live. Stay in touch there!
>
> Cheers,
>
> Peter

For the most part, though, it isn't. True, it is only a stretch of 18 months that stand between the fellow who wrote this Facebook post and the one who is writing this blog post now, but the gap included a quarter crisis, a bald, successful and liberating career change and a thorough introduction into mindfulness and meditation practices. With a risk of making a claim that I myself will disagree with in the future, I have learned many of the most important lessons of my life.

Yet the comments I have on my last Facebook post would only point out the need for a tad bit more stylistic polish and a tad fewer strong words (also, dchisel.com isn't live anymore, though it was a cute site in its days). Other than that, the content is still very much agreeable to me. That said, it is best understood with some context and reflection, which I am just about to attempt below.

Right after I made the post live from the 24th floor of a Manhattan high-rise I used to work in during the week and tutor in on the weekends, I hopped on the subway to ride home to Bushwick, Brooklyn. I didn't expect to get much of a reaction (I have never been very active on Facebook), and sure enough, after an hour underground without cellular data, all I got was a handful of messages from people jokingly disappointed that they won't have a way to stay in touch with me anymore ('Good job, 21st century', I said to myself). Two days later, I deactivated, and didn't log back in again until I decided to fully delete my account earlier this year.

A close friend deactivated a couple of months after I did, and the fact that my act served as encouragement for hers was just about the most positive reaction I got. Among the rest was some whispered praise, a lot of lifted eyebrows, and some outloud ridicule. The only rational response came from my mother as I insisted on waiting to somehow get the e-mail address of my brother's former high school classmate who could advise me on foreign tax matters: "I know it's against your principles, but..". What followed was that I should get on Facebook, because that is the only way to reach him (I later found out that he in fact does not check his Facebook, and happily replied to the e-mail after two hours).

But then came something surprising: the ridicule I got was followed up with apologies, corrections and expressions of respect. Here is an attempted reproduction:

> Actually, I only meant to rip on people who deactivate their accounts with an oh-so-wise farewell message and silently slip back after three weeks. What you did was legit. 

On the other hand, the approval I got tended to come with doubts on how I am a real earthly being whom they can even poke in the shoulder (unclear intentions with regards to the pun). Time and time again I found myself thinking:

> Wow, we have some seriously mixed feelings about Facebook.

Mixed feelings extend to among journalists who write on the 'Facebook, good or bad?' topic (though I didn't find anything good other than Facebook's own evaluation). Several, such as this [Huffington Post Article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/facebook-study_n_5595890.html), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy), [Huffington again](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html) or [Facebook's own study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/29/facebook-experiment-psychological_n_5540018.html) voiced adverse mental health effects that stem from lack of purpose, envy triggered by other people's flawlessly pictured lives, comparing, out- and overdoing and then comparing again. Myself, many of my close friends (I mean, friends), and surely many many others were aware of these adverse effects of the Facebook experience. But perhaps even more obvious is the fact that these effects would rarely stand a chance against our fundamental desire to fit in and be accepted, a simple truth that explains why people will keep posting, liking and poking whether it is good for them or bad. Going against this is a rare game to be played.

[One Atlantic article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/ways-to-use-facebook-without-feeling-depressed/389916/) finally offered a more positive voice on Facebook, focusing on its healthy use instead of lamenting on the apparently inevitable unhealthy one. If we use Facebook healthily, we may break free from adverse effects, even if the interviewer and interviewee of the article spoke hesitantly about the extent to which this is possible. Supposing that it is, then mustering the willpower to not compare ourselves to others would, as the article suggests, free us from negative emotions. Sure, we'd still have to deal with other bad addictions such as the ones to like maximization or stalking, but it's a start. If I let my optimistic nature be in charge for a bit, I may even feel that deleting the account is an overkill.

But I am also a realist, and I remember disliking my Facebook experience, so I slowly, softly let that idea go once more. After a bit of further pondering, I arrived at the following conclusion: whoever deletes their account should really just admit to weak willpower. Sigh. Well, here we go:

> My name is Peter, I am 25 years old, and I have weak willpower.

In retrospect, I did not find this confession especially hard. In fact, if you give me a crowd, a pedestal and a flashy bow tie and I will happily repeat it in public. It gets even easier for me as I look at all the psychological research and [self-improvement websites](http://fiercegentleman.com/science-of-behavior-change/) backing me up. All of a sudden, I feel more companionship and validation than what I got from hundreds of Facebook friends back in the day.

If I freaked out and lapsed back into defense about it, I would probably tell this story: about a year ago, I decided to quit alcohol and processed sugar (which, by the way, along with quitting Facebook, seems like the recipe for immortality), and I stuck to it with the exception of one glass of wine and two pieces of my mother's pastry when I visited home after a year and a half. However, according to my current Facebook presence, that still does not mean I have more willpower than my roommate's pitbull (you should see her trying to abstain from peanut butter).

I certinly agree with all the voices out there saying that Facebook isn't bad, and if I use it right, I should be fine. However, using it right includes not doing a whole lot of things the platform encourages us to do by its design. The lack of focus when it comes to content and the encouragement to make as many friends as possible (more is better, right?) are two aspects that I believe create the Facebook experience that I walked away from, while staying on all other online platforms that had profiles and friend relationships. Maybe I have weaker willpower than others, and maybe browsing Facebook impacts me more negatively. Or perhaps it is the case that many others would also walk away from Facebook (don't we hear that yearning a lot?) if not for a couple of seriously compelling reasons:

* if they could only make the confession I made above (which is really easy).
* if they were not concerned about losing touch with other people (especially since the only alternative to Facebook is the sassy and unreliable messenger pigeon).
* if their group, school, club etc. didn't use it as sole means of communication (which is such a good choice of medium that I am give out medals for it).
* if they were willing to give up the convenience of its messaging system (certainly more important than mental health).

Given this amazing web and mobile technology on our hands today (with many of the coolest innovations being developed among Facebook's own developer teams), such reasons still have the power to keep us pursuing recreational experiences that don't make us feel good. As much as this leaves me with a hint of sadness, there is also something really great about it. Mixed, conflicting feelings around Facebook use, the voices out there saying:

> Oh my god, Facebook is so bad, but look at that adorable cat on my best friend's selfie. 

only indicate that we are social media adolescents, and it is taking us some time to become adults who know what they want and go easy on themselves. It can only propel us towards a better social media experience, which, by the way, has been out there all along (we just can't find the time for it). I myself have non-addictive, meaning- and joyful time discovering music on Soundcloud, looking for a place to crash on and new friends on Couchsurfing.com, and find people with similar interests on Meetup. Maybe it is the focused nature of these sites that takes away Facebook's staleness and subtle mental taxation. Maybe we'll shift more in this focused direction, maybe in a different one, maybe we'll shift trends on what to post, who we friend and what we like on Facebook. Regardless of what the road is, I know that we will be moving for the better. It is not in our nature to stand still when we feel about something the way we do about Facebook.

And so, all I want to leave you with is to share with you how stoked I am for the future. Oh, and also a request: be so kind to e-mail me the details of that board game night this coming Saturday. Somehow I missed the last four.
