We often look back at things we wrote in the past with a slight uneasy feeling. It could be an opinion we don't agree with anymore, a paragraph exposing stronger versions of the shortcomings we're still working on, thoughts we would rather hide from others or at least rewrite/explain before sharing. It could also be something we just never really meant.

My Facebook post that rolled out in the sunny Sunday afternoon of February 23rd, 2014 could be one of them today:

> Dear Friends,
>
> I am deactivating my Facebook account in the coming days. It is finally time to break free of all the clutter it comes with. Also time to keep communication genuine and meaningful.
>
> My Gmail, Skype, Etsy store and website (etsy.com/shop/dchisel and dchisel.com) will obviously remain live. Stay in touch there!
>
> Cheers,
> Peter

For the most part, though, it isn't. True, it is only a stretch of 18 months that stand between the fellow who wrote this Facebook post and the one who is writing this blog post now, but the gap included a quarter crisis, a bald but wildly successful and liberating career change and a thorough introduction into mindfulness and meditation practices. With a risk of making a claim that I will myself disagree with in the future, I have learned many of the most important lessons of my life.

Yet the comments I have on the writing would only point out the need for a tad bit more stylistic polish and a tad less strong words (also, dchisel.com isn't live anymore, though it was a cute site in its days). Other than that, the content is agreeable to me, though in the way it was phrased, it is best understood with some context and reflection. It is time to attempt that now.

Right after I made the post live from the 24th floor of a Manhattan high-rise I used to work in during the week and tutor in on the weekends, I hopped on the subway to ride home to Bushwick, Brooklyn. I didn't expect to get much of a reaction (I have never been very active on Facebook), and indeed, all I got was a handful of messages from people jokingly disappointed that they won't have a way to stay in touch with me anymore ('Good job, 21st century', I said to myself). Two days later, I deactivated, and didn't log back in again until I decided to fully delete my account earlier this year.

A close friend deactivated a couple of months after I did, and the fact that my act served as encouragement for hers was just about the most positive reaction I got. Among the rest was some whispered praise, a lot of lifted eyebrows, and some outloud ridicule. The only rational response came from my mother as I insisted on waiting to somehow get the e-mail address of my brother's former high school classmate who could advise me on foreign tax matters: "I know it's against your principles, but..". What followed was that I should get on Facebook, because that is the only way to reach him.

And then came the surprising part: the ridicule I got was followed up with apologies, corrections and expressions of respect. Here is an attempted reproduction: 'Actually, I meant the tease/insult [take your pick, dear reader] only on the people who deactivate their accounts with an oh-so-wise farewell message and silently slip back after three weeks. What you did was legit'. On the other hand, the approval I got tended to come with doubts on how I am a real earthly being - which was especially awkward after they realized they could touch my arm. 'Wow', I said to myself, 'our feelings on Facebook are very mixed. As if we did not know how to talk about it'.

Mixed feelings extend to among journalists who write on the Facebook, good or bad topic (though I didn't find anything good other than Facebook's own evaluation). Several, such as this [Huffington Post Article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/facebook-study_n_5595890.html), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy), [Huffington again](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html) or [Facebook's own study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/29/facebook-experiment-psychological_n_5540018.html) voiced adverse mental health effects such as lack of purpose, envy triggered by passively focusing on the post about other people's flawlessly pictured lives. These are aspects of the site that myself and many of my close friends (I mean, friends) were aware of. I could go as far as to say that this is nothing new.

One article I found took things one step further. [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/ways-to-use-facebook-without-feeling-depressed/389916/) article talking about 'healthy Facebook use' seemed like a very good next step to investigate. If we use Facebook healthily, we may break free from all these adverse effects. The article investigated the question of whether this is possible, reaching no clear conclusion, but at least sheding light on the matter properly.

Perhaps, then, mustering the willpower to not compare ourselves to others would make things better. Sure, we'd still have to deal with other bad addictions such as the ones to like maximization or stalking, but it's a start. With willpower, there may be a way to render my childish delete-my-account thing an overkill. My conclusion: whoever deletes their account should man up and admit to weak willpower. Well, let's get it over with, then:

> My name is Peter, I am 25 years old, and I have weak willpower.

I did not find this confession especially hard, and when I look at the vast amounts of psychological research backing me up, it gets easier. All of a sudden, I feel more companionship and validation than what I got from hundreds of Facebook friends back in the day.

If I freaked out and lapsed back into defense about it, I would probably tell this true story: about a year ago, I decided to quit alcohol and processed sugar, and I stuck to it with the exception of one glass of wine and two pieces of my mother's pastry when I visited home after a year and a half. Clearly, according to my current Facebook presence, that still not mean I have more willpower than my roommate's pitbull.

Given the voices out there talking about how unhappy Facebook makes us, it is sad to me that we settle for it. We have this amazing web technology on our hands (with many of the coolest innovations being developed among Facebook's own developer teams), and somehow we are ok with recreational experiences that don't make us feel amazing.

Allow me to not leave you with bitter writing. I am not proposing the death of Facebook, judging its users (willpower is weak, remember?), or boasting on my special status as too good for Facebook (take it from me: very few are the social circles in which this is cool). I simply wanted to

I use Facebook's own framework.
