I often feel an internal drive to do things, not just work, but anything technical or creative on the side as a well-rounded, well-researched, well-though-out... let's take a moment here before I bombard you with a rather heavy, mindboggingly overused word: project.

I am not crazy about the fact that we use this word on everything. To me, projects carry with them an expectation of completedness, as we juggle around our project deadlines, following the project plan, meeting with the project management team so we can feel good with our project evaluations. But here is the catch that has been on my mind recently: there is a good chance that before the project is complete, we get to a point where we cease to enjoy or grow from doing it. Which really calls for fewer projects.

So, to steer things in the right direction, what this blog post presents instead are, and indeed you guessed it, projects. This time, however, I am taking the word for its etymological meaning: something I threw (jacere) forth (pro). Pretty casual and open-ended for a change, right? I collected things I did so far that fits into this new, highly personal interpretation: things I did without a pressure to complete or justify, but just kind of do, show, then look and wonder. Which you should do too.

Here is my first animated microfilm, an homage to the communist icon vehicle of my native Romania, the Dacia 1100.
