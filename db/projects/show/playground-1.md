I often feel an internal drive to do things, not just work, but technical or creative side projects, dinner meals, exercise, even meditation as a well-rounded, well-researched, well-though-out... let's take a moment here before I bombard you with a rather heavy, mindboggingly overused word: project.

I am not crazy about the fact that we use this elegant, professional word on everything. To me, projects carry around with them an expectation of completedness, whether used on a large-scale construction project (because we feel uneasy with steel girders left hanging from the sky), a final project for a class (because we want that degree), or a garage rework project (ok, this is often unfinished). But here is the catch that has been on my mind recently: there is a good chance that before completion, we get to a point where we cease to enjoy it or grow from doing it. Which really calls for fewer projects.

So, to steer things in the right direction, what this blog post presents instead are, and indeed you guessed it, projects. This time, however, I am taking the word for its etymological meaning: something I threw (jacere) forth (pro). Pretty casual, right? I collected things I did so far that fits into this new, highly personal interpretation: things I did without a pressure to complete or justify, but just kind of do, show, then look and wonder. Which you should do too.

Here is my first animated microfilm, an homage to the communist icon vehicle of my native Romania, the Dacia 1100.
