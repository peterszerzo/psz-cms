'Busted, Peter', I said teasingly to myself.

I cannot say I did anything bad, merely something childish. Again, I let my near perfectionism take over the steering wheel. I felt an internal drive to do everything I did, not just work, but technical or creative side projects, dinner meals, exercise, even meditation as a well-rounded, well-researched, well-though-out... let's take a moment here before I bombard you with a heavy, hopelessly overused word... ok, here it goes: project. 

To be honest, I am not crazy about this word, or more precisely, not crazy about the fact that we use it on everything. To me, anything that is a project carries with it an expectation of completedness. And the point at which a project is complete rarely coincides with the point at which we cease to enjoy or grow from the activity.

Not to imply that this is a bad thing, I'm actually really glad it is like this. But carrying it over to more and more aspects of my life gives me a certain uneasy feeling. And creating such uneasy feelings for myself is pretty childish, and is so in a bad way.

This blog entry attempts to steer things around in a direction that is still childish, but this time in the right way. There is going to be very little talking from now on - just a list spontaneous, barely-thought-about things I created up to this point in my life.
