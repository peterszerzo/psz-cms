It could be an opinion we don't agree with anymore, a paragraph exposing stronger versions of the shortcomings we're still working on, thoughts we would rather hide from others or at least rewrite/explain before sharing. It could also be something we just never really meant.\n\nMy Facebook post that rolled out in the sunny Sunday afternoon of February 23rd, 2014 could be one of these today:\n\n> Dear Friends,\n>\n> I am deactivating my Facebook account in the coming days. It is finally time to break free of all the clutter it comes with. Also time to keep communication genuine and meaningful.\n>\n> My Gmail, Skype, Etsy store and website (etsy.com/shop/dchisel and dchisel.com) will obviously remain live. Stay in touch there!\n>\n> Cheers,\n>\n> Peter\n\nFor the most part, though, it isn't. True, it is only a stretch of 18 months that stand between the fellow who wrote the Facebook post and the voice you are reading now, but that gap happened to include a quarter crisis, a bald, successful and liberating career change and a thorough introduction into mindfulness and meditation practices. With a risk of making a claim that I myself will disagree with in the future, I have learned many of the most important lessons of my life.\n\nYet the comments I have on my last Facebook post would only point to the need for a tad bit more stylistic polish and a tad fewer strong words (also, dchisel.com isn't live anymore, though it was a cute site in its days). Other than that, the content is still very much agreeable to me. That said, it is best understood with some context and reflection. It is time to do some of that now.\n\nRight after I made the post live from the 24th floor of a Manhattan high-rise I used to work in during the week and tutor in on the weekends, I hopped on the subway to ride home to Bushwick, Brooklyn. I didn't expect to get much of a reaction (I have never been very active on Facebook), and sure enough, after an hour underground without cellular data, all I got was a handful of messages from people jokingly disappointed that they won't have a way to stay in touch with me anymore ('Good job, 21st century', I said to myself). Two days later, I deactivated, and didn't log back in again until I decided to fully delete my account earlier this year.\n\nA close friend deactivated a couple of months after I did, and the fact that my act served as encouragement for hers was just about the most positive reaction I got. Among the rest was some whispered praise, a lot of lifted eyebrows, and some outloud ridicule. The only rational response came from my mother as I insisted on waiting to somehow get the e-mail address of my brother's former high school classmate who could advise me on foreign tax matters: \"I know it's against your principles, but..\". What followed was that I should get on Facebook, because that is the only way to reach him. I later found out that he in fact does not check his Facebook, and happily replied to the e-mail after two hours.\n\nBut then came something interesting: the ridicule I got was followed up with apologies, corrections and expressions of respect, a generic example of which I attempted to reproduce here:\n\n> Actually, I only meant to rip on people who deactivate their accounts with an oh-so-wise farewell message and silently slip back after three weeks. What you did was legit. \n\nOn the other hand, the approval I got tended to come with doubts on how I am a real earthly being whom they can even poke in the shoulder (unclear intentions with regards to the pun). Time and time again I found myself thinking:\n\n> Wow, we have some seriously mixed feelings about Facebook.\n\nMixed feelings extend to among journalists who write on the 'Facebook, good or bad?' topic (though I didn't find anything good other than Facebook's own evaluation). Several, such as this [Huffington Post Article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/facebook-study_n_5595890.html), [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-facebook-makes-us-unhappy), [Huffington again](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html) or [Facebook's own study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/29/facebook-experiment-psychological_n_5540018.html) voiced adverse mental health effects that stem from lack of purpose, envy triggered by other people's flawlessly pictured lives, comparing, out- and overdoing and then comparing again. Myself, many of my close friends (I mean, friends), and surely many many others were aware of these adverse effects of the Facebook experience. What I also knew was that such arguments tend to not stand a chance against our fundamental desire to fit in go with the crowd, explaining why people will keep posting, liking and poking whether it is good or bad for their emotional well-being. Going against this is a rare game to be played.\n\n[One Atlantic article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/ways-to-use-facebook-without-feeling-depressed/389916/) finally offered a more positive voice on Facebook, focusing on its healthy use instead of lamenting on the apparently inevitable unhealthy one. If we use Facebook healthily, we may break free from adverse effects, even if the interviewer and interviewee of the article spoke hesitantly about the extent to which this is possible. Supposing that it is, then mustering the willpower to not compare ourselves to others would, as the article suggests, free us from negative emotions. Sure, we'd still have to deal with other bad addictions such as the ones to like maximization or stalking, but it's a start. If I let my optimistic nature be in charge for a bit, I may even feel that deleting the account is an overkill.\n\nLuckily for me, I am also a realist, and I also do not forget. I vividly remember the restless, achy, sometimes nauseous feeling in my head and stomach after browsing too much, believing overly positive representations or misrepresentations of people's lives, or getting dozens of birthday wishes from people who only occasionally say hi to me on the streets. Forcing an optimistic thinking onto myself in this case would be nothing but an utterly pointless act of hipocrisy. The line of thought ultimately let me to the following conslusion: whoever deletes their account should really just admit to weak willpower. Sigh. Well, here we go:\n\n> My name is Peter, I am 25 years old, and I have weak willpower.\n\nI have to say, this confession was way easier than I had thought. In fact, if you give me a crowd, a pedestal and a flashy bow tie, I will happily repeat it in public. It gets even easier as I look at all the psychological research and [self-improvement websites](http://fiercegentleman.com/science-of-behavior-change/) backing me up. All of a sudden, I feel more companionship and validation than what I got from hundreds of Facebook friends back in the day.\n\nAbout a year ago, I decided to quit alcohol and processed sugar (which, along with quitting Facebook, seems like the recipe for immortality), and I stuck to it with occasional exceptions while traveling. However, according to my stance on Facebook, I possess just about as much willpower than my roommate's pitbull (you should see her trying to abstain from peanut butter). It took me time and intense bursts of frustration, but I am finally ok with it. In fact, I believe that embracing it will do me a lot of good.\n\nI certinly agree with all the voices out there saying that Facebook isn't bad, and if I use it right, I should be fine. However, using it right includes not doing a whole lot of things the platform encourages us to do by its design. The lack of focus when it comes to content and the encouragement to make as many friends as possible (more is better, right?) are two aspects that I believe create the Facebook experience that I walked away from, while staying on all other online platforms that had profiles and friend relationships. Maybe I have weaker willpower than others, and maybe browsing Facebook impacts my possibly rare personality type more negatively. Or perhaps it is the case that many others would also walk away from Facebook (don't we hear that yearning a lot?) if not for a couple of seriously compelling reasons:\n\n* if they could only make the confession I made above (which is really easy and liberating).\n* if they were not concerned about losing touch with other people (especially since the only alternative to Facebook is the rather sassy and unreliable messenger pigeon).\n* if their group, school, club etc. didn't use it as sole means of communication (which is such a good choice of platform that I am sending out honorary medals for it as we speak).\n* if they were willing to give up the convenience of its messaging system (certainly more important than mental health).\n\nGiven this amazing web and mobile technology on our hands today - with many of the coolest innovations being developed among Facebook's own developer teams - such reasons still have the power to keep us pursuing recreational experiences that don't make us feel good. Sad and depressing as this sounds, there is also something really great about it. What mixed, conflicting feelings around Facebook use indicate to me is that we are mere social media adolescents. The voices out there saying:\n\n> Oh my god, Facebook is so bad, but look at that adorable cat on my best friend's selfie. \n\nshows that it is taking us some time to become the social media adults whose experience engaging in digital connection make them feel somewhat similar to the way face-to-face human connection should make them feel: amazing. It can only propel us towards a better social media experience, one whose sprouts may already be out there. I happen to have non-addictive, meaningful and all-in-all a good time discovering music on Soundcloud, looking for a place to crash on and new friends on Couchsurfing.com, and find people with similar interests on Meetup. Maybe it is the focused nature of these sites that takes away Facebook's staleness and subtle mental taxation. Maybe we'll shift more in this focused direction, maybe in a different one, maybe we'll shift trends on what to post, who we friend and what we like on Facebook. Regardless of what the road is, I know that we will be moving for the better. It is not in our nature to stand still when we feel about something the way we do about Facebook.\n\nAnd so, all I want to leave you with is to share with you how stoked I am for the future. Oh, and also a request: be so kind to e-mail me the details of that board game night this coming Saturday.

Otherwise, help yourselves right below for a couple of ideas on the following topics:\n* a focused look at interactive data visualizations within larger front-end architectures.\n* a smarter flavor of geodata that reintroduces featureful data models inside interactive map views.\n* a scetch of a visualization lifecycle that works the same way for various forms of displayable data, whether they need additional shape files loaded or not.\n* a structure for rendering code that works with all of the above.\n\nThe technology stack: [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) render using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) data models, carried over into [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) format. That said, the ideas and code samples from this post may work well with other MV* frameworks or in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) apps, and especially as lightweight helpers if you don't use a framework at all.

I hope you enjoy!\n\n# Interactive GeoData Visualizations within Client-side Apps\n\nOn the combined use of ``Backbone.js``, a minimalistic MV* framework and ``d3.js``, the most popular data visualization library, Shirley Wu said the following: \"Yup, I totally agree, it's really not that difficult. But what I do think is challenging (and interesting), is to use them together well\". I resonated not only with her statement, but with her code examples she presented [on Backbone Conf III 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqXD0_tGPv8&list=PLlgxAbM67lYIGw8DnANC7VgREbzJRQged&index=7). I think they did a really good job ironing out the differences in which object-oriented Backbone views and functional d3 rendering workflows can be blended together. In an ever-so-slightly different flavor, these ideas found their way into my work as well.\n\nThings got yet more interesting when I turned to using ``d3`` for geomapping applications within a larger MV* app. The prominent data structure for mapping, GeoJSON (or TopoJson, which becomes GeoJSON inside the app anyway), looks quite a bit different than a Backbone model or collection. It has custom [format](http://geojson.org/), may weight hundreds of kilobytes, and tends to not be available with uploaded spreadsheet data that I was mapping, requiring an additional ajax call and further joining/processing. Working with it took some time to get accustomed to, and here is an approach that worked well for me.\n\n# The Data Side: GeoJSON, Enriched\n\n## A Short-lived Misconception of Rigid Geodata\n\nIn several MV* frameworks, models are available in the views with all their convenience methods. ``this.model.getSummary()``, ``@resource.aggregate()`` show up in view code across languages and frameworks for our enjoyment and convenience. When I started out rendering GeoJSON-based data, I thought I had to abandon this luxury for seemingly rigid, static constructs like the following:\n\n\tgeoJson = {\n\t\ttype: 'FeatureCollection',\n\t\tfeatures: [\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'Point',\n\t\t\t\tgeometry: { /* geometry here */ },\n\t\t\t\tproperties: { /* static data here. wait - static only? */ },\n\t\t\t\tid: 1 /* maybe I can join to models in outside collections every time I need to? */\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t]\n\t}\n\nSeeing my data buried into a set data structure, lacking model instance methods or template helpers I've been using extensively made me think that I had to say goodbye to the [Rails-like, playful comfort](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3873-programming-with-toys-and-magic-should-be-relished-not-scorned) of my prior MV* work. But this really does not have to happen.\n\nMy initial take was to examine the feature object for an ``id`` or any other property I could use to link to an outside, comprehensive data model, keeping my good old collection separate from the GeoJSON. But I knew I could swim against the current less. Turns out, if I passed a GeoJSON file over to a ``d3`` rendering module with rich, logic-packed Backbone models smuggled into its feature collection, I would get no complaints. Here is what I ended up with:\n\n\tfeatures: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t_model: /* a freshly added, or injected, Backbone model instance */,\n\t\t\ttype: 'Point',\n\t\t\tgeometry: { /* geometry here */ },\n\t\t\tproperties: { /* this we don't even need from this point on */ }\n\t\t}\n\t]\n\nIf we look at a sample rendering code, we see how easily we retrieve these references when setting properties and event handlers, a feature I was so used to and so reluctant to abandon.\n\n\td3.selectAll('path')\n\t\t.data(geoJson.features)\n\t\t.enter()\n\t\t.append('path')\n\t\t// insert code here that assigns 'd' attributes on the path based on feature geometry data\n\t\t.attr('class', function(feature) {\n\t\t\tvar model = feature._model;\n\t\t\t/* Hello, model! */\n\t\t})\n\t\t.on('click', function(feature) {\n\t\t\tvar model = feature._model;\n\t\t\t/* And hello again! */\n\t\t});\n\nTo facilitate smuggling, or more formally, injecting model references into a GeoJSON object, I wrote a constructor that generates GeoJSON-like objects directly passable to d3 for rendering, along with some mixins and convenience methods for building, extending or converting static data into the above format. I named this constructor ``stg.RichGeoJSON()`` (mind the ``stg``, or scaling tricks for geo namespace), referenced in the test project and in the post from this point on.\n\nI was very excited to find that ``d3`` is so welcoming to smarter objects like this, so I went ahead and enhanced them some more. Could a build-in event system be useful? Anything else? Let's find out.\n\n### The Self-sufficient GeoModel\n\nLet's think through the process of mapping some datasets with some ``new stg.RichGeoJSON()``'s. First up:\n\n\tcollectionData = [\n\t\t{ name: 'pin one', size: 2, latitude: 37, longitude: 78 },\n\t\t{ name: 'pin two', size: 1, latitude: 37.1, longitude: 77 },\n\t\t{ name: 'pin three', size: 6, latitude: 37.3, longitude: 72 }\n\t];\n\nI would personally make the inner objects into Backbone models, squeeze the latitudes/longitudes into arrays to populate each GeoJSON feature's ``geometry`` field, add a model reference to the feature under the ``_model`` key, build all features up into a GeoJSON, and ship it off to ``d3`` for rendering (scroll down for more on that). The ``stg.RichGeoJSON`` constructor even provides a method to do this automatically with some room for customization:\n\n\t// stg.Pins extends from Backbone.Collection\n\tcollection = new stg.Pins(collectionData);\n\n\trichGeoJson = new stg.RichGeoJSON();\n\t// the second argument provides possible keys where geodata may be found\n\trichGeoJson.buildFromLatLongCollection(collection, {\n\t\tlatKeys: [ 'lat', 'latitude', 'Lat' ],\n\t\tlongKeys: [ 'long', 'longitude', 'Long' ]\n\t});\n\t// proceed to rendering\n\nAs a bonus feature, I added support for messy, inconsistent data that may contain latitude and longitude values under different keys. This allowed me to work with data that has inconsistent format without the need to reconfigure parsing methods each time.\n\nLeaving it at that for now, our next dataset looks like this:\n\n\t// 2013 population data taken from Wikipedia for demonstration purposes.\n\tstatesData = [\n\t\t{ name: 'Nebraska', population: 1868516, region: 'Midwest' },\n\t\t{ name: 'Arizona', population: 6626624, region: 'Southwest' }\n\t];\n\nAfter we've made this into a Backbone Collection and realized we're dealing with states (a check my collection does with a typechecker module, not discussed in this post), we can load in our trusted ``us-states.geo.json`` with ``jQuery``'s or ``d3``'s ajax helpers, make it into RichGeoJSON instance, use its helpers to blend in the models of our collection into the features, and our data is ready for rendering once more:\n\t\n\t// stg.States extends from Backbone.Collection\n\tstates = new stg.States(states);\n\n\t$.get('data/us-states.geo.json', function(data) {\n\t\tvar richGeoJson = new stg.RichGeoJSON(data);\n\t\t// join by name\n\t\trichGeoJson.injectCollection(states, 'name', injectOptions);\n\t\t// proceed to rendering\n\t});\n\nThe ``injectOptions`` specifies additional options that can be used to match models with GeoJSON features. It is not currently implemented in the example, but it is definitely something I'd like to explore in detail in a later discussion. Some features it could include:\n* case-sensitivity.\n* the number of characters that can be extra or off (a collection item with ``name: 'new\\tjerseyx'`` could still be matched with a feature with ``name: 'New Jersey'``).\n* backup join keys. If there is no name field match, maybe there is a ``'state'``, or we can try our luck with an ``'id'``.\n* an entirely custom, project-specific join function, taking a model and a feature as parameters, and returning a boolean telling us whether they match.\n\n``#injectCollections()`` would then return join statistics such as how many collection items could be injected, if there were several that could have been injected into the same GeoJSON feature, and so on (feature not yet implemented in the test project). Join options, back up keys and join strictness could then be refined based on the feedback from any previous attempt, even to a certain degree of automation. This workflow is sketched out in comments for now, and I welcome further ideas and code contribution to finish it up.\n\nThis approach works well for apps where multiple data formats need to be supported (inconsistent data, user input). An alternate approach would be to format the data to make the join logic more universal. After [Tom MacWright](http://www.macwright.org/about/) kindly devoted some of his time to review this post, he suggested the following syntax:\n\n\tstatesData = [\n\t\t{ \n\t\t\tname: 'Nebraska', \n\t\t\tpopulation: 1868516, \n\t\t\tregion: 'Midwest',\n\t\t\tgeometry: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'Join',\n\t\t\t\tid: 'Nebraska',\n\t\t\t\tcollection: 'states'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t{ \n\t\t\tname: 'Arizona', \n\t\t\tpopulation: 6626624, \n\t\t\tregion: 'Southwest',\n\t\t\tgeometry: {\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'Join',\n\t\t\t\tid: 'Arizona',\n\t\t\t\tcollection: 'states'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t];\n\nBy formatting data this way, either the ``#injectCollections()`` method becomes much simpler to facilitate building a separate ``RichGeoJson`` instance, or, since this is already starting to look like a GeoFeature, shape data may end up right inside the collection data.\n\n## Sync and Async GeoJSON in the Same App\n\nThe above implementations for the US states visualization and the map pins one look a bit different. The latter is synchronous and yields ``richGeoJSON`` immediately, while the former may keep a spinner icon waiting through a two-second server lag before it retrieves the shape data and carries on with the rendering. I am not very happy keeping these different implementations in mind, adding rendering logic in different places, one roaming free and the other buried inside an ajax callback. I settled with writing asynchronous(-looking) code whether I needed it or not, as follows:\n\n\tvar richGeoJson = new stg.RichGeoJSON();\n\t// set callback to execute when object is ready\n\trichGeoJson.onReady(function() {\n\t\t// call rendering module with rich data\n\t});\n\t// construct richGeoJson here, whether through build-from-lat-long or ajax-fetch-and-inject\n\t// onReady called automatically when things are ready.\n\nThe ``richGeoJson`` instance will remember to execute its ``onReady`` method after either a build or an inject is complete, at which point we have all we need to send our logic-packed shapes over to rendering. I found this code to be more readable and uniform, making my app behave the same for whatever data that rolled in. In the end, I managed to share a fair amount of code between rendering ready-available latitude-longitude points or shape files. Rendering \n\n# The View Side\n\nThe data- and model-related implementations above centered around polymorphism, and view-related ones did the same. From my very first experiences tinkering with d3 code, I had a hard time keeping my code clean, and generally felt sceptical that most d3 code examples available online, with all their nesting and lack of high-level clarity, could scale (in saying so, I do not mean to imply that these insightful pieces of code failed at their intended purpose).\n\nAt this point, I really got used to Backbone views, and so, inspired by Shirley's code examples, I ended up splitting up my d3 code into methods of a custom view object - methods that copy a Backbone view's API and thus behave like any other view my app uses.\n\n\t/* \n\t *  Extend from Marionette.js' Object constructor to have access to an event system\n\t *  and an initialize method.\n\t */ \n\tstg.GeoView = Marionette.Object.extend({\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Backbone's initializer called when an instance is created.\n\t     * Sets container and data.\n\t     */ \n\t\tinitialize: function(options) {},\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Render visualization, set attributes and event listeners.\n\t     * Called only when the data changes.\n\t     */ \n\t\trender: function() {},\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Render the visualizations svg container and an inside group. \n\t     * Store these on the instance.\n\t     */ \n\t\trenderSvgContainer: function() {},\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Set or update attributes. Called within render, and as a lightweight update method\n\t     *   when the data doesn't change, but its presentation does (e.g. when a map is recolored).\n\t     */\n\t\tsetAttributes: function() {},\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Get class name for a feature. \n\t     * Use _model references to have access to attributes and instance methods.\n\t     */\n\t\tgetFeatureClass: function(feature) {},\n\n\t\t/*\n\t     * Destroys view by unbinding event listeners and removing dom elements.\n\t     */\n\t\tdestroy: function() {}\n\n\t});\n\nFor those of you familiar with the [BackboneD3View](https://github.com/akre54/Backbone.D3View) project, you may notice the many similarities. This time, I simply opted for a more simplistic solution, lightly built from scratch.\n\n# All Together\n\nPutting all the pieces together, here is how a map pin visualization could look like:\n\n\t(function(data) {\n\n\t\tvar mapItems = new Backbone.Collection(data);\n\n\t\tvar richGeoJson = new stg.RichGeoJson();\n\n\t\trichGeoJson.onReady(function() {\n\t\t\tnew stg.GeoView({ \n\t\t\t\tel: '.viz', \n\t\t\t\trichGeoJson: richGeoJson \n\t\t\t}).render();\n\t\t});\n\n\t\trichGeoJson.buildFromLatLongCollection(mapItems);\n\n\t}());\n\nNote that this is by no means polished code. On actual applications, I moved all logic generating ``richGeoJson`` into an instance method on the collection. Generating the view ended up in a controller module. The API changed a little bit to conform to make things more consistent across a larger codebase. My goal here is not to present a library, perhaps just a few ideas on how one could be created, if a formalized version makes sense for your project. In this example, extending the view from a handy, well-documented base class would undoubtedly make things a bit more clear. This could become an open-source miniproject, and if you're interested in having it around, please let me know.\n\n# So, Worth it?\n\nI think so. From personal experience, these tricks do give some organizational and semantic clarity, more code reuse and more flexibility to implement new features. What do you think? Care to do me a favor and head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/pickled-plugins/scaling-tricks-for-geo/issues) and write down some thoughts?\n\nOtherwise, or until then, happy mapping!"}]
