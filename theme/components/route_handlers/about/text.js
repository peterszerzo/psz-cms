This is Peter, developer, designer, (natural) language enthusiast, yogi, cook. A friendly, low-bullshit fellow with eager-to-pedal feet, a green thumb and a curious mind.

I make sites and apps - the full-stack thereof - though my strengths and heart lie in clean, well-factored user interfaces and beautiful, elaborate graphics. I work with and get inspiration from the following technologies: React, Backbone, Marionette, d3.js, three.js, and Sass on the front-end, and Node, Express and Rails behind the scenes. I am also quite interested in coding outside of the browser, from architectural and jewelry design to animation, computational art and natural language processing.

Also, I teach! From helping a friend through the (insanely hard) Romanian mathematics baccalaureat through high-school English, pre-med Physics, digital fabrication and finally mentoring a web developer intern, I take enjoyment in communicating, explaining and listening, and most importantly, igniting excitement both around and within me.

You can find me on my bike on the streets of Copenhagen, one of its nicer coffee shops, the local React meetup, here and there online. Let's talk!
