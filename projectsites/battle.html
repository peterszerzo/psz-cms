	<p class="col-8">The Miami Marine Stadium [the on-shore backstage from which the Battle Shell performances are viewed from] has recently been appropriated by graffiti artists, to whom no surface is off-limits. Rather than see this as dereliction, we see this as a sign of the youthfulness and desire for expression that is now embedded in the character of the stadium. We hope to incorporate this energy into the stadium’s future. Rather than build a platform for teens to watch their idols perform, we propose the Miami Marine Stadium as a place for teens to take the stage. The ‘battle’ is a type of performance specific to the performing arts of contemporary youth culture. Though difficult to stage in typical performance spaces, the battle scenario will be spatially accommodated by proposed split bandshell stages, with the possibility to combine into a larger, single stage for more traditional events.</p>

	<p class="col-6">For the project, I've used my particle-springs algorithm implemented in Visual Basic to generate a unit in a shape of a eighth of a sphere. The algorithm was adjusted to provide a shape that combines smoothly with its symmetric twin sibling, such they can come together to form a large, unified roof surface (see plan drawing).</p>

	<p class="col-6">Although the shape has an organic feel, it does not result from a particle-spring equilibrium - the simulation is stopped about three quarters of the way, trading off its structural efficiency with many other architectural requirements.</p>
