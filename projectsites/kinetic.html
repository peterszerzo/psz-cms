	<p class="col-4">The mast was built as proof of concept for a structure that adapts its shape based on outside weather conditions.</p>

	<p class="col-4">The acrylic prototype was equipped with a number of heat sensors along its height. If any of them was triggered, a linear actuator lowered the tower to the height of the trigger.</p>

	<p class="col-6">I was responsible for detailed design of the 3d geometry, as well as programming the sensors and the linear actuator.</p>

	<p class="col-6">The prototype was demoed to middle school students in New Jersey in the fall of 2010. The students interacted with the prototype, making it lower to a certain height by applying hot air using a blowdrier.</p>

	<p class="col-6">At the same time, the a computer screen displayed the current and target geometries of the tower. Humans, computer and prototype all interacted by responding to and validating each othersâ€™ actions.</p>

	<p class="col-6">The design concept was published in Engineering Structures.</p>
